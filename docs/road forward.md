I think it is excellent.

"AWS Cloud Quest" is one of the best ways to get "hands-on" without the fear of breaking things. It turns learning into a game (building a city) where you solve technical problems to progress.

Why it pairs effectively with our project:

Cloud Quest (The Theory/Click-Ops): You will learn what a VPC is and how to set it up by clicking around in their simulated console. It builds the mental model.
This Project (The Engineering): We will then take that concept and build it programmatically using Python and CloudFormation.
Example:

Quest: "Fix the slow website by adding a Load Balancer." (You drag and drop in the game).
Our Project: "Write a Python script to deploy an Application Load Balancer using boto3."
If you do both in parallel, you will be unstoppable. You'll understand the "what" (Quest) and the "how to automate it" (Our Code).

Ready to start Module 1? As a future Data/AI Engineer, IAM (Identity & Access Management) is your most critical tool. You need to know how to give a machine permission to read a database without giving it permission to delete it.

Shall we build the IAMManager class now?
